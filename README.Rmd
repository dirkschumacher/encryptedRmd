# Password protected html markdown documents

Self-encrypt html markdown reports using sodium. The goal is to provide functionality to password protect markdown html documents and share them with others securely. The code needed to decrypt the file is bundled into the exported html file, which makes the resulting file fully self contained.

*Use at your own risk. Feedback and bug reports very welcome!*

## Installation

``` r
remotes::install_github("dirkschumacher/encryptedRmd")
```

## Functions

### Encrypt html files

```{r}
library(encryptedRmd)
encrypt_html_file("devel/example/test.html", output_path = "docs/test.encrypted.html")
```

You can take a look at the exported file [here](https://dirkschumacher.github.io/encryptedRmd/test.encrypted.html) and use the key printed above to decrypt it.

### Encrypted rmarkdown html format

```yml
---
title: "test"
output: encryptedRmd::encrypted_html_document
---
```

See [here](devel/example/) for an example. After knitting, the document is encrypted with a random key and the file is stored in the same directory together with the key.

## Inspiration

Inspired and based on the work by @derhuerst on [self encrypting html pages](https://github.com/derhuerst/self-decrypting-html-page).

## License

## Development

In `devel/r-encrypted-html-template` the code to generate the javascript file is contained. In order to update the template, you have to run the following:

* In `devel/r-encrypted-html-template` run `npm run build`. This creates a new version of the template and copies it to `devel/html-template.js`. It also creates a file called `JSLICENSES.txt` that contains all licenses of used node packages.
* In `devel` run `combine.R`. This generates the file report template and copies it to `inst/html-template.html`. This template is then used within the R package to generate encrypted html files.
